The projects are linked to my first project that I have done during the course,and the others for the time being are linked to github. The page is visible on different screens.

I have learned how to use CSS ans how to style a page and use flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables and how to work on different platforms (Visual Studio Code, the terminal, GitHub), and to make sure that everything alignes with the initial wairframe.

The deployed version you can find it here:
